## ✨ Vision  

> **“If culture is not preserved, memory is lost. If memory is lost, the future is blurred.”**  

The **Somali Culture AI Project** is a groundbreaking initiative to create the **first centralized digital repository** of Somali oral traditions, proverbs, poetry, songs, and cultural practices.  
By leveraging **Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning, and NLP**, we aim to **safeguard the Somali heritage** for future generations, researchers, and communities worldwide.

## 🎯 Mission  

- 📖 Collect, digitize, and archive **oral histories, proverbs, stories, and poetry**.  
- 🎙️ Record **high-fidelity audio and video performances** of Somali traditions.  
- 📊 Structure the data into a **multimodal dataset** (text, audio, image, video).  
- 🤖 Enable **AI-powered transcription, translation, and cultural knowledge retrieval**.  
- 🌍 Create a **living archive** accessible to scholars, communities, and future AI systems.

## 🚀 Getting Started  

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shermack/somali-ai-model.git
   cd somali-ai-model

    Explore the data (start with /data for proverbs & oral texts).

    Contribute new content

        Add files in the right folder.

        Follow the metadata template.

        Submit a Pull Request (PR).

✅ Contribution Guidelines

    Always respect cultural sensitivity.

    Credit storytellers, elders, poets, and contributors.

    Use the metadata schema (language, region, type, date, consent).

    Ensure translations are accurate (Somali → English/Swahili).

🔬 CI/CD Automation

Every contribution is checked through GitHub Actions:

    ✅ JSON/CSV validation.

    ✅ Metadata completeness.

    ✅ Automatic formatting & cleanup.

This ensures our dataset is clean, reliable, and ready for AI training.
🌐 Futuristic Somali Viewpoint

This project is not just a dataset — it is a time capsule of Somali wisdom.

    AI models trained on this data will speak, translate, and preserve Somali culture.

    Researchers will gain authentic cultural datasets.

    Somali youth and diaspora will see their culture represented in future technologies.

    “We are not just archiving the past — we are coding the future of Somali identity.”
